[Rule]

# # This project is a fully personal-maintained Surge network security rule set, aimed at helping global users build their own local network defense systems, enhancing the ability to identify and block DNS poisoning, APT attacks, and malicious IP traffic. We adhere to principles of technical neutrality, information transparency, and independent autonomy. We do not accept any form of capital injection, commercial investment, or monetization cooperation to ensure the neutrality, fairness, and independence of the project.

## > Monitoring / Auditing / DPI and Other High-Risk Node Blocking Rules – Includes airport nodes, suspicious open ports, abnormal VPS behavior, DPI activities, and segments suspected of GFW operations. (Blocking is recommended)

# # Behavioral Fingerprinting & Cloud Service Analysis – Blocking based on behavioral patterns such as DNS query characteristics and TLS fingerprints (e.g., Client Hello), combined with identification of grey-market SDKs and analytics nodes (recommended to block).

## > Pegasus Spyware Domains – Derived from public threat intelligence sources such as Amnesty International and Citizen Lab (Recommended to block)

// All credit goes to the Amnesty International team. I do not intend to profit or steal the limelight. This rule set was created purely out of goodwill for community protection.

// All domains were extracted from the Pegasus investigation report and formatted for the SurgeAegis project.

// Original data source: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/pegasus-project/

// This rule set will be continuously maintained. Community contributions of up-to-date IOCs are welcome.
