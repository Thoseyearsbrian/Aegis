A high-performance, cross-platform rule repository focused on network-layer defense. Designed for Surge, Clash, QuantumultX, and OpenWrt. Protects against APT threats, DNS poisoning, malicious C2 traffic, SDK telemetry, and botnet sources. Supports iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, and router platforms.

## **Project Background**

[Aegis](https://github.com/Thoseyearsbrian/Aegis) is a fully self-maintained, open-source rule set project focused on modern network-layer threats. It helps users worldwide build localized, client-side firewall systems by blocking DNS pollution, APT attack infrastructures, SDK tracking domains, backdoor communications, and malicious C2 servers. It includes rules against global high-risk threats such as Pegasus spyware C2 infrastructure and anomalous behavior patterns.

The project enforces encrypted DNS usage and explicitly blocks plaintext DNS requests to ensure communication security, transparency, and full user-side traffic control. Even on devices such as iPhones, which lack traditional endpoint protection, Aegis provides effective flow-level protection.

Additionally, the project provides an optional high-trust module ‚Äî CA_Block.list ‚Äî which blocks controversial or publicly revoked root CAs, OCSP endpoints, and CRL domains worldwide. This is intended for users with high digital trust requirements and helps reduce risks related to man-in-the-middle attacks or malicious certificate chains.

## **Key Features**

Aegis is designed to detect and block the following high-risk communications:

- APT command-and-control (C2) infrastructure
- SDK telemetry and behavioral fingerprinting
- DNS poisoning / injection / hijacking behavior
- Botnets, remote access Trojans, and malware C2 channels
- Ad tracking, behavior analytics, and listening CDNs

It supports **Surge**, **Clash**, **QuantumultX**, **OpenWrt**, and other platforms, and works on iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, and router environments. Rules follow a unified structure with professional annotations, making them readable, auditable, and easy to integrate.You can optionally enable the advanced module CA_Block.list, which blocks high-risk root CA validation behaviors to further strengthen protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

## **Philosophy**

Aegis adheres to technical neutrality, information transparency, and complete independence. I firmly believe every individual has the right to understand and control their network traffic. Therefore, Aegis does **not** accept any form of commercial investment or capital control. To ensure purity, trust, and security, all configurations are handcrafted and audited by me, with complete annotations to guarantee every rule is transparent, verifiable, and pollution-free.

## **Auto Update**

Aegis uses GitHub-based versioning and automation to stay up to date without manual intervention. It supports remote subscription through Surge, Clash, QuantumultX, and other tools.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Notes**

1. **Disable or remove** CN-specific rules such as:

```
RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thoseyearsbrian/Aegis/main/rules/China.list,DIRECT
GEOIP,CN,DIRECT
```

2. Place GEOIP,CN rule right before the final rule:

```
GEOIP,CN,DIRECT
FINAL,REJECT
```

3. The GeoIP database only includes **mainland China** IPs. Avoid querying other countries:



```
GEOIP,US,PROXY  # Invalid
GEOIP,HK,PROXY  # Invalid
GEOIP,CN,DIRECT # Valid
```
