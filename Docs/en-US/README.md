## **Overview**

Personal digital firewall ruleset for [Surge](https://nssurge.com), focused on identifying potential communication threats at both the application-layer and transport-layer. It covers a broad range of suspicious behaviors including [DNS poisoning]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking)), [APT threat sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat), [SDK telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit), [Backdoor Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_door), [PCDN relay communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2P_caching), [C2 controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/?redirect=no&title=Command_and_control), and other potentially malicious communications. The project also expands domain-based identification to major global advertising platforms, behavioral tracking services, and adult content sites, enabling users to achieve fine-grained local traffic identification and classification on iOS/macOS and define their own network policies.

In addition, the project incorporates rule sets targeting globally recognized high-risk threat infrastructures, including detection strategies for [Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware))￼ spyware and its associated command-and-control infrastructure.

The project fully enforces encrypted DNS, rejecting plaintext queries to ensure secure and private communications. Even on devices lacking traditional security software — such as iPhones — Aegis provides effective protection at the network traffic layer.

## **Key Features**

The Aegis rule set is dedicated to identifying and classifying the following high-risk communication behaviors:

- Ad domain identification, behavioral tracking, and surveillance-style CDN nodes
- PCDN relay traffic and shared-bandwidth transmission
- Botnets, remote access Trojans, and malware C2 channels
- SDK telemetry and behavioral fingerprinting
- APT command-and-control (C2) infrastructure
- DNS poisoning / injection / hijacking behavior

Aegis is purpose-built for the Surge platform, fully compatible with both iOS and macOS. It offers high readability, auditability, and modular deployment — making it suitable for policy-based routing, communication analysis, and enhanced security configurations.

An optional advanced module — CA_Block.list — is also available, aimed at blocking globally controversial or publicly revoked root certificate authorities, OCSP responders, and CRL domains. This module is intended for users with heightened digital trust requirements, offering additional protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and malicious certificate chains.

## **Philosophy**

Aegis adheres to technical neutrality, information transparency, and independent autonomy. I firmly believe every individual has the right to understand and control their network traffic. Therefore, Aegis does not accept any form of commercial investment or capital control. To ensure purity, trust, and security, all configurations are handcrafted and audited by me, with complete annotations to guarantee every rule is transparent, verifiable, and pollution-free.

## **Auto Update**

Aegis is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) with an automated update mechanism, ensuring that all rule sets remain up-to-date and are fully compatible with remote subscription in Surge.

If configuration auto-reload is not enabled, you can manually refresh external resources or reload the profile to ensure the ruleset stays up to date.

### Versioning

Aegis follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) : vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH  e.g., Aegis v3.0.1,MAJOR=3、MINOR=0、PATCH=1

MAJOR (X) : Major changes in structure or compatibility  👉 Requires re-downloading the configuration and re-adding nodes

MINOR (Y) : New policy groups, new modules, or new features  👉 Recommended to re-download the configuration and re-add nodes

PATCH (Z) : Rule fixes, annotation updates, minor improvements  👉 No need to re-download the configuration; updating external resources is sufficient

💡 It is recommended to enable 「Automatically reload if the profile was modified externally/remotely」.This option only applies to automatic reloading when the configuration file (.conf) changes.PATCH updates still require manually refreshing external resources (RULE-SET) to take effect.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Rule Mode is mandatory — Aegis cannot perform any filtering, routing, or protection without it**

   ```bash
   Aegis is a personal digital firewall system built entirely on Surge’s Rule Mode. It relies on rule-based matching to classify domains, enforce policies, and block malicious traffic.

   Full functionality is only available when Surge is running in **Rule Mode**. If you switch to Global Mode or Direct Mode, while network access may still work, all rule matching will be bypassed, leading to the following risks:

   • Domains and IPs will not be classified correctly  
   • All filtering mechanisms and strategy modules will be disabled  
   • Core functions like traffic splitting, threat protection, and ad blocking will stop working

   If you encounter a domain temporarily inaccessible due to unmatched rules, you may **switch to Global Mode or Direct Mode temporarily** to regain access. However, we strongly recommend submitting an Issue immediately, so we can update the corresponding rule set and prevent future disruption.
   ```

2. **It is recommended to combine China.list (for domain matching) and GEOIP,CN (for IP segments) for accurate detection of Chinese traffic:**

   ```bash
   RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thoseyearsbrian/Aegis/main/rules/China.list, DIRECT   # Precisely matches Chinese domains
   GEOIP,CN,DIRECT                                                                                  # Matches traffic from Chinese IPs not in domain list
   FINAL,REJECT                                                                                     # Final fallback rule (do NOT place GEOIP below this)
   ```

3. **Supports GEOIP query rules for countries outside mainland China, as the current database supports global country IP ranges.**

   ```bash
   GEOIP,US, PROXY   # Valid
   GEOIP,AU, PROXY   # Valid
   GEOIP,CN, DIRECT  # Valid
   ```

4. **Explanation for the message “tun-excluded-routes parameter configured, may cause issues after switching networks”**

   ```bash
   This message is not an error or conflict but a system-level reminder from Surge.  
   It can be safely ignored in a fixed network environment.  
   If you experience temporary LAN communication issues (e.g., AirDrop, Bonjour, or NAS) after switching networks such as Wi-Fi ↔ hotspot, select “Stop Proxy” → “Start Proxy” in the menu to rebuild the routing table and restore connectivity.
   ```
