**Aegis**



A high-performance, cross-platform rule repository focused on network-layer defense. Designed for Surge, Clash, and OpenWrt. Protects against APT threats, DNS poisoning, malicious C2 traffic, SDK telemetry, and botnet sources. Supports iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, and router platforms.

## *Project Background**

**Aegis** is a personally maintained open-source rule repository dedicated to modern network-layer threat defense. It helps users worldwide build localized, client-side firewall systems by blocking DNS pollution, APT attack infrastructures, SDK tracking domains, backdoor communications, and malicious C2 servers. It includes rules against global high-risk threats such as Pegasus spyware C2 infrastructure and anomalous behavior patterns.

The project enforces encrypted DNS usage and explicitly blocks plaintext DNS requests to ensure communication security, data transparency, and full traffic control. Even on devices like iPhones that lack traditional antivirus software, Aegis provides effective flow-level protection.

## **Key Features**

Aegis is designed to detect and block the following high-risk communications:

- APT command-and-control (C2) infrastructure
- SDK telemetry and behavioral fingerprinting
- DNS poisoning / injection / hijacking behavior
- Botnets, remote access Trojans, and malware C2 channels
- Ad tracking, behavior analytics, and listening CDNs

It supports **Surge**, **Clash**, **QuantumultX**, **OpenWrt**, and other platforms, and works on iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, and router environments. Rules follow a unified structure with professional annotations, making them readable, auditable, and easy to integrate.

## **Philosophy**

Aegis adheres to technical neutrality, information transparency, and complete independence.

I firmly believe every individual has the right to understand and control their network traffic.

Therefore, Aegis does **not** accept any form of commercial investment or capital control. To ensure purity, trust, and security, all configurations are handcrafted and audited by me, with complete annotations to guarantee every rule is transparent, verifiable, and pollution-free.

## *Auto Update**

Aegis uses GitHub-based versioning and automation to stay up to date without manual intervention. It supports remote subscription through Surge, Clash, QuantumultX, and other tools.

## *‚ö†Ô∏è Notes**

1. **Disable or remove** CN-specific rules such as:

```
RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thoseyearsbrian/Aegis/main/SurgeAegis/rules/China.list,DIRECT
GEOIP,CN,DIRECT
```

1. Place GEOIP,CN rule right before the final rule:

```
GEOIP,CN,DIRECT
FINAL,REJECT
```

1. The GeoIP database only includes **mainland China** IPs. Avoid querying other countries:



```
GEOIP,US,PROXY  # ‚ùå Invalid
GEOIP,HK,PROXY  # ‚ùå Invalid
GEOIP,CN,DIRECT # ‚úÖ Valid
```
