A network security ruleset meticulously maintained for Surge, focused on application- and transport-layer defense. It blocks DNS poisoning, APT infrastructure, SDK telemetry, backdoor communications, and C2 controllers. The ruleset also extends to block global advertising, behavioral tracking, and adult content domains ‚Äî enabling precise, verifiable, and privacy-focused local traffic filtering for iOS and macOS.

## **Overview**

[Aegis](https://github.com/Thoseyearsbrian/Aegis)is a network security rule set developed and maintained long-term by an independent developer. It focuses on countering modern network-layer threats and aims to help global users build localized and effective defense systems. The project blocks DNS poisoning, APT threat sources, SDK telemetry, backdoor domains, and C2 controllers, and further extends its coverage to major global advertising, behavioral tracking, and adult content domains ‚Äî enabling precise identification and efficient interception of local traffic. It also includes rules for numerous high-risk attack sources worldwide, including communication infrastructure and behavioral signatures related to Pegasus spyware.

The project fully enforces encrypted DNS, rejecting plaintext queries to ensure secure and private communications. Even on devices lacking traditional security software ‚Äî such as iPhones ‚Äî Aegis provides effective protection at the network traffic layer.

In addition, Aegis offers an optional advanced module ‚Äî CA_Block.list ‚Äî which targets controversial or revoked root certificate authorities, OCSP endpoints, and CRL domains worldwide. This module is designed for users with higher digital trust requirements, helping to reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and malicious certificate chains.

## **Key Features**

Aegis is designed to detect and block the following high-risk communications:

- Ad tracking, behavior analytics, and listening CDNs
- Botnets, remote access Trojans, and malware C2 channels
- DNS poisoning / injection / hijacking behavior
- APT command-and-control (C2) infrastructure
- SDK telemetry and behavioral fingerprinting

Aegis is specifically designed for the Surge platform, fully compatible with both iOS and macOS systems. It offers excellent readability, auditability, and modular deployment capabilities, making it ideal for various use cases such as policy routing and firewall-assisted configurations.You may optionally enable the advanced module CA_Block.list to block high-risk certificate validation behaviors and CA-related traffic, further enhancing your defense against man-in-the-middle attacks.

## **Philosophy**

Aegis adheres to technical neutrality, information transparency, and complete independence. I firmly believe every individual has the right to understand and control their network traffic. Therefore, Aegis does not accept any form of commercial investment or capital control. To ensure purity, trust, and security, all configurations are handcrafted and audited by me, with complete annotations to guarantee every rule is transparent, verifiable, and pollution-free.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

1. **Rule Mode must be enabled; otherwise, the Aegis rule set will not function properly**

   ```bash
   Aegis is a personal firewall system specifically designed for Rule Mode. It only works correctly when Surge is set to Rule Mode. 
   If you use Global Mode or Direct Mode, rules will not match, domain/IP classification will fail, and all protection and routing functionalities will be lost.
   ```

2. **Disable or remove CN-specific rules such as:**

   ```bash
   RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thoseyearsbrian/Aegis/main/rules/China.list,DIRECT   # Disable or remove similar rules
   GEOIP,CN,DIRECT                                                                                 # Cannot coexist with the rule above
   ```

3. **Place GEOIP,CN rule right before the final rule:**

   ```bash
   # ... other rules ...
   GEOIP,CN,DIRECT   # Recommended to place here
   FINAL,REJECT      # Final rule
   ```

4. **The GeoIP database only includes mainland China IPs. Avoid querying other countries:**

   ```bash
   GEOIP,US,PROXY   # Invalid, no matching records
   GEOIP,AU,PROXY   # Invalid, no matching records
   GEOIP,HK,PROXY   # Invalid, no matching records
   GEOIP,CN,DIRECT  # Valid
   ```
